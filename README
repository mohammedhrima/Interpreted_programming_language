# Current project is in Progress ...

- I've tried to build a mini programming language that has syntax similar to python with C

+ data types:
    characters : character or string
    boolean    : true or false
    number     : digits or floats
    array      : starts with '[' and ends with ']'
    object     : starts with '{' keys + values '}'

    example:
        char_value   = "hello world"
        bool_value   = true
        num_value    = 3.14
        array_value  = [1,2,3,5]
        object_value = {
                        name: "user",
                        age: 25
                        }               

+ comments:
    for one line of comment use : // my comment
    for bloc of comments use    : """
                                    bloc of
                                    multiple
                                    comments
                                  """

+ built in functions:
    output: it's simalar to print in python
        examples:
            output("hello world\n")

            obj = {
                name: "user",
                age: 10
            }
            output(obj)

            output("hello" + " world\n")
            etc ...

    input: it's similar to input in python
        input("write your text here to show to user")
        it read input as string

    range: it return array of number, takes two arguemnts, number to starts with and th end with
        example:
            range(2, 8) // return [2,3,4,5,6,7]

+ statements and loop:
    if "condition":
        bloc of code te execute
    
    example:
        x = 10
        if x > 0:
            output("is positive\n")
        elif x == 0:
            output("is zero\n")
        else:
            output("is negative\n")

    while "condition":
        bloc of code to execute

    example:
        x = 0
        while x < 10:
            x += 1

    for loop:
        example:
        for x in range(0, 10):
            output(x)
        
        str = "abcdef"
        for i in range(0, str.len):
            output(str[i])
    
    there is also, break, continue key words 

+ function declaration:
    func my_func(param1, param2):
        // bloc of code to execute
    
    to call it:
        my_func(1, 2)

+ data type attributes:
    characters:
        len
