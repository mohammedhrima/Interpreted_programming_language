- I tried to build a mini programming language that has syntax similar to python with C

- I've also borrow some attributes from javascript X'D
- You can check the tutorial for more details

## how to use

```bash
  ./a.out your_file.txt
```


## how to use

- Clone the repo
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/mohammedhrima/Push_swap_Tester
```

- Test your push_swap by running 
```bash
  make tests -C ./Push_swap_Tester
```

- Debug your push_swap by running 
```bash
  make debug -C ./Push_swap_Tester
```


- when running the program, you will get the following outputs:
```bash
    how many tests you want:                        // number of tests 
    how many generated numbers you need: 100        // 100 generate number
    with negative numbers ? [y/n]:                  // yes or no
    Press Enter to start the test...
```
